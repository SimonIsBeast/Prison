================================
You are building Prison.

Note that you are probably using
a development build and therefore
a buggy build. Don't use it on a
production server unless you know
what you are doing! You have been
WARNED.

Output files will be in
[subproject]/build/libs, suffixed
with "-dist". Have fun!
